This Unity plugin integrates our Aurora SDK into a package that can be included in Unity 3D applications, and includes the latest versions of both our iOS and Android Aurora SDKs.

Our Aurora SDK contains huge leaps forward in our capabilities, with benefits for both publishers and advertisers. We would also like to highlight the addition of AdColony Compassâ„¢ to our suite of products. AdColony Compass provides publishers with intuitive marketing tools to maximize the value of users throughout your app economy, like creating rewards, achievements, push notifications and in-app messaging.

Please feel free to explore the [Compass Platform](https://github.com/AdColony/AdColony-iOS-SDK-3/wiki/Compass-Overview). For more details on how you can take advantage of Compass, please [click here.](https://clients.adcolony.com/compass/info)
