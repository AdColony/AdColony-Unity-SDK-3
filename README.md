Here is the link to the [release notes](https://github.com/AdColony/AdColony-Unity-SDK-3/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for all the previous SDK versions.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. In the Unity Editor, select "Assets"->"Import Package"->"Custom Package". Navigate to the location of the AdColony SDK Unity Plugin and select "AdColony.unitypackage".
1. Select "Import" to import all the assets into your project.
1. The AdColony SDK Unity Plugin includes Google's PlayServicesResolver to automatically pull in necessary Google Play Services libraries. If there are conflicts with this, the `play-services-ads` library is the only required. You can choose to ignore this PlayServicesResolver installation, remove the `AdColony/Editor/ADCDependencies.cs` file, and include the `play-services-ads` in another way.
1. The Plugins/Android/AdColony/AndroidManifest.xml file is automatically generated. To update manually, select "Tools"->"AdColony"->"Update AndroidManifest.xml".

## Upgrade 

#### SDK 3.x:
In order to support thin/fat Android builds, we moved the native .so files from the `Plugins/Android/AdColony/libs` folder to the `Plugins/Android/libs` folder. Removing the `Plugins/Android/AdColony` folder before importing AdColony SDK Unity Plugin 3.1.0 is recommended. Otherwise, simply remove the `Plugins/Android/AdColony/libs/armeabi-v7a` and `Plugins/Android/AdColony/libs/x86` folders.

#### SDK 2.x:
Please note that updating from our 2.x Unity Plugin is not a drag and drop update, but rather includes breaking API and process changes. In order to take advantage of the 3.x Unity Plugin, a complete re-integration is necessary. Please review our [documentation](https://github.com/AdColony/AdColony-Unity-SDK-3/wiki) to get a better idea on what changes will be necessary in your app.
